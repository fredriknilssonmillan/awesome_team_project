• Project Description

The user will be able to search for a specific beer category or brand, and will be able to know where that beer is sold. Tha platform will inform the user about nearby restaruants where the beer is sold, how the weather is at that place at specific days, and what are the nearby hotels (to avoid drink and drive).

• Sketch of final product

1. Input form to select the beer.
2. Display of a table with results
3. Repeat step 1 to filter results until the specific brand is reached
4. Platform will display all the available info of the beer, an image of the label or the beer
5. The user selects the specific location (from the list of the locations where the label is sold).
6. The platform displays the weather forecast for the next days and the nearby restaurants
7. The user selects a restaurant (if possible, throught yelp, opentable, etc., make a reservation for a specific day)
8. The page displays the list of nearby hotels to the chosen restaurant (if possible on a map)


• APIs to be used (so far, could change)

https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/apps
https://rapidapi.com/raygorodskij/api/Zomato
https://rapidapi.com/brianiswu/api/open-brewery-db
probably yelp, open table, or trip advisor have apis that can be used

3. When user selects destination, the platform should display the weather for every day of the week
4. The platform should display recommended restaurants on the location where the beer is sold
5. Once the restaurant is selected, the platform should display nearby hotels

• Development activities

1. Create a simple mock-up in order to have a design guideline
2. Create the html
3. Link with Bootstrap and CSS
4. Design the database
5. Pseudocode all the java and jquery code
6. Read and undesrstand the documentation of the API's, generate the keys, and test the funcionalities
7. Incorporate de API's to the code
8. Develop
9. Assemble
10. Test

• Possible new technologies
1. Drill down on tables (both front and back)
2. User data validation
3. Different libraries that have not been used
4. Integration with maps (if possible)
