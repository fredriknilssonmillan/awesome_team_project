• Project Description

The user will be able to search for a specific beer category or brand, and will be able to know where that beer is sold. Tha platform will inform the user about nearby restaruants where the beer is sold, how the weather is at that place at specific days, and what are the nearby hotels (to avoid drink and drive).

• Sketch of final product



• APIs to be used (so far, could change)

https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/apps
https://rapidapi.com/raygorodskij/api/Zomato
https://rapidapi.com/brianiswu/api/open-brewery-db
probably yelp, open table, or trip advisor have apis that can be used

• Rough breakdown of tasks

1. Select a beer category, then a class, and finally brand
2. Once brand is selected, display the destinations where brand is sold
3. When user selects destination, the platform should display the weather for every day of the week
4. The platform should display recommended restaurants on the location where the beer is sold
5. Once the restaurant is selected, the platform should display nearby hotels
