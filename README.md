• Project Description

The user will be able to search for a specific beer category or brand based on a certain location that could be referenced to the users location by geolocalization or allowing the user to enter it manually. Tha platform will inform the user about nearby restaruants, how the weather is at that place at specific days, and what are the nearby hotels (to avoid drink and drive).

• Sketch of final product

1. Through an API, the platform will be able to geolocalize the location of the user
2. If the user wants to intorduce manually a location, he could do so
3. The user should be able to write a beer brand, and the platform should tell if that beer is sold and that locations
4. In an advenced search, the user should be able to filter by beer category
5. Platform will display all the available info of the beer, an image of the label or the beer
6. The platform displays the weather forecast for the next days and the nearby restaurants and nearby hotels to taht location
7. The platform displays known events in the location


• APIs to be used (so far, could change)

https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/apps
https://rapidapi.com/raygorodskij/api/Zomato
https://rapidapi.com/brianiswu/api/open-brewery-db
probably yelp, open table, or trip advisor have apis that can be used

• Rough breakdown of tasks

1. INput location (manually or by georeference)
2. Write a beer lable or in an advanced search select a beer category, then a class, and finally brand
3. Display only the beers sold at the specific location
4. The platform should display the weather for every day of the week on that location
5. The platform should display recommended restaurants on the location (not necessary where beer is sold)
6. The platform should display hotels in that location
7. The platform should display events in the location

• Development activities

1. Create a simple mock-up in order to have a design guideline
2. Create the html
3. Link with Bootstrap and CSS
4. Design the database
5. Pseudocode all the java and jquery code
6. Read and undesrstand the documentation of the API's, generate the keys, and test the funcionalities
7. Incorporate de API's to the code
8. Develop
9. Assemble
10. Test

• Possible new technologies
1. Drill down on tables (both front and back)
2. User data validation
3. Different libraries that have not been used
4. Integration with maps (if possible)
